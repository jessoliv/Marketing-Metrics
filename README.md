# Marketing-Metrics
## Overview 
Using SQL to gain insights about the state of marketing metrics specifically Account MQLs, Disco/Demo Events, and Pipeline Coverage

## Summary
This project is a modified version of the metrics that were compiled each week for the marketing team to view the state of the sales funnel. It uses 3 tables: Accounts, Opportunities, and Events. Each of these tables contains a sample of the available fields. See Marketing-Metrics-ERD for full view of tables and fields involved.
